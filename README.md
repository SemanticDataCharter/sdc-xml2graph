# sdc-xml2graph
A Python tool to create knowledge graphs from SDC4 models and xml data. 
Given a SDC4 data model and a XML instance, this tool will validate (using sdcvalidate) and transform your data instances into either an RDF Graph (N-Quads)or Property graph (GQL create statements) data for that model.
